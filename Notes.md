### Notes on how to run and other stuff

#### Undirected Graphs

1. Introduction:
   
   - python3 Test.py tinyG.txt

2. Commit 2: implemented graph api in file Graph.py. They are not part of Graph class yet. but [Graph.java](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/Graph.java.html) has them as class members. May be later. No output.
   
   adj implemented as list of lists and not bags

3. Depth First search: DepthFirstPaths implements simple depth first search as shown  in lecture
   
   - python3 DepthFirstPaths.py tinyG.txt

4. Breadth First search: implemented distanceto too

  - python3 BreadthFirstPaths.py tinCG.py

5. Connected components: python3 ConnectedComponents.py tinyG.txt

#### Directed Graphs

All the files can be run similarly as above, contains 3 DG, tinyDG, tinDG2, tinDG3. Which ones needed for the job, needed to be checked manually. BarebonesWebCrawler was simple implementation of Breadth first web crawler, it works but barely!
